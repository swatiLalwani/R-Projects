# 🚴‍♀️ Cyclist Performance Analytics Project (R)

## 🎯 Objective
Analyzed cyclist performance data to identify key factors impacting speed, endurance, and training efficiency. Built predictive and clustering models to support data-driven training optimization.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
**Language:** R  
**Libraries:** dplyr, ggplot2, tidyr, caret, randomForest, e1071  
**Techniques:** EDA, Feature Engineering, Regression Modeling, Clustering, Hypothesis Testing, Visualization  

## 📈 Project Workflow
1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**
   - Cleaned and transformed raw cycling performance data (speed, distance, cadence, heart rate, weather, terrain).
   - Engineered derived metrics (average speed, elevation gain, training zones).

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualized trends between weather, terrain, and performance using ggplot2.
   - Identified strong correlations between cadence, terrain type, and speed (r ≈ 0.72).

3. **Modeling**
   - Built regression models predicting average speed with R² = 0.89.
   - Used Random Forest for non-linear relationships; improved RMSE by 15%.
   - Applied K-Means clustering to segment cyclists into 3 performance profiles (Elite, Intermediate, Recreational).

4. **Insights & Recommendations**
   - Cyclists perform 18% better on flat terrain and under mild temperatures.
   - Training intensity (heart rate > 160 bpm) correlates with improved endurance scores.
   - Recommended customized training plans by segment to optimize performance.

# ⚾ Moneyball Player Performance Analytics (R)  

## 🎯 Objective
Applied data analytics and predictive modeling to identify undervalued baseball players who deliver high performance relative to their cost — enabling data-driven roster building under budget constraints.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
**Language:** R  
**Libraries:** dplyr, ggplot2, caret, randomForest, e1071  
**Techniques:** EDA, Feature Engineering, Regression Analysis, Predictive Modeling, Data Visualization  

## 📊 Workflow Overview
1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**
   - Processed player performance data (BA, OBP, SLG, RBI, HR, SB) from multiple seasons.  
   - Handled missing values, normalized features, and treated outliers.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Identified strong positive correlation between OBP/SLG and overall player success.  
   - Visualized key relationships using scatter plots and correlation heatmaps.  

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Derived advanced metrics like OPS (On-Base + Slugging) and Value Index (performance vs. cost).  
   - Standardized player attributes to enable cross-league comparisons.  

4. **Modeling**
   - **Linear Regression:** Predicted player performance metrics (R² = 0.86).  
   - **Random Forest:** Improved prediction accuracy by 12% (MAE reduced to 3.8).  
   - **Logistic Regression:** Classified players into “High Value” vs. “Low Value” categories (accuracy 91%).  

5. **Insights & Recommendations**
   - Found OBP and SLG to be top predictors of success (importance scores >0.8).  
   - Identified undervalued players with cost-performance ratio improvements of 25–35%.  
   - Demonstrated how advanced metrics outperform traditional scouting indicators (e.g., batting average).  

## 🧩 Business Impact
| Finding | Impact | Business Relevance |
|----------|--------|-------------------|
| Predictive modeling accuracy 91% | Reliable player ranking | Informs recruitment & budgeting |
| Value Index metric | 25–35% cost-performance gain | Resource optimization |
| OBP & SLG emphasis | Improved scouting precision | Data-driven decision-making |

1,"First, please comment if you have any questions and I would love to respond to help!

I had the AirPods Pro Gen1 prior to these, but the new AirPods blew them out of the water. The added ear tips make customability even better especially for small ears like mine.

The Active Noise Cancellation is clearly superior to the first generation and the addition of Adaptive audio is super cool and very useful.

The battery is even better than I was expecting. The AirPods charge super fast in the case, and the case charging itself is also super fast. The USB-C cord is a very nice addition especially with the new, more common, USB-C charging block. The new Apple Braided USB-C cord is also a small but nice touch.

I personally do not use the ring on the side, but I imagine many people may find it useful. The addition of the Find My capabilities with both the case and the AirPods themselves is beyond helpful because I always seem to misplace them. Small bonus, every time you charge the case or the AirPods, the case sounds off a little chime to let you know that they are charging or if the battery is low.

As an owner of the AirPods Max and a former owner of the AirPods Pro gen 1, I would 100% recommend this new generation. The noise cancellation is superior to the gen 1, but slightly behind the Maxes because they are in-ear instead of over-ear. If you want the maxes, I would get them, but it depends on your activities. The AirPods Pro are ideal because they are small, descrete, and light weight. You can slip them in your pocket or place just one in your ear. They are also very useful and comfortable to use while working out, as opposed to the maxes.

The AirPods are quite durable too. If my first pair is any indication to this pair, then I promise you, they can take a beating. After 4 years of having the first gen AirPods Pro, I have thrown them around, dropped them hundreds of times and they often got small scratches, but only chipped once or twice after higher falls on super hard surfaces. But they worked every single time.

Long story short, if you’re on the fence, get them. They are super great for travel, workouts/runs, house chores, and all activities in general.

Hope you find this helpful, if you have any questions please comment them!"
2,"I'll start by saying that I previously owned a pair of original AirPods for several years, and while they served me well, I felt it was time for an upgrade. Enter the AirPods Pro—an extraordinary improvement in every way. The first thing that struck me was the sound quality. It's a massive leap from the original AirPods, offering rich, deep bass that adds a new dimension to my favorite tracks. The highs are beautifully crisp, bringing out details in music that I hadn't noticed before.

Another standout feature is the noise cancellation. Whether I'm on a noisy commute or in a crowded café, the AirPods Pro do an impressive job of muting the background noise, allowing me to fully immerse myself in the audio experience. The transparency mode is equally impressive, seamlessly letting in outside sounds when needed without having to remove the earbuds.

The fit of the AirPods Pro is another significant upgrade. The customizable ear tips make them much more comfortable for extended wear, and they stay secure even during workouts. I never had that with the original AirPods, which would occasionally slip out.

Battery life is solid, and the wireless charging case is a convenient bonus. The overall build quality feels premium, with a sleek design that continues the minimalist aesthetic Apple is known for.

In short, the AirPods Pro have exceeded my expectations in every way. They’re a must-have for anyone looking to elevate their audio experience, whether you’re upgrading from the original AirPods or new to the Apple ecosystem. Highly recommended."
3,"As an avid user of the original AirPods Pro, I was excited to upgrade to the 2nd generation model. The differences are immediately noticeable, with a richer, more immersive audio experience courtesy of the new H2 chip. The noise cancellation has been significantly improved, providing up to 2x better performance in blocking out ambient noise. This is a game-changer, especially when I'm using them during my bike rides or other active pursuits.

One of the most practical upgrades is the ability to easily adjust the volume directly on the earbuds themselves. This simple yet effective addition has made a substantial difference in my daily use, allowing me to quickly fine-tune the audio without needing to reach for my connected device.

Another feature I've come to appreciate is the speaker built into the charging case. As someone who tends to misplace things, this has been a lifesaver, making it much easier to locate my AirPods Pro when they inevitably get lost in my bag or around the house.

The customizable fit remains a standout feature, with the included silicone tips allowing me to achieve a secure, comfortable seal that effectively blocks out external noise. The overall dust, sweat, and water resistance also provide peace of mind when using these earbuds in more active environments.

While the price tag is still on the premium side, the 2nd generation AirPods Pro deliver a truly exceptional audio experience that justifies the investment. The combination of improved noise cancellation, volume controls, and the handy charging case speaker make this a worthy upgrade for anyone seeking the best-in-class true wireless earbuds."
4,"I've owned all versions of airpods, normal, pro, max, etc. My favorite one for the longest time was the Airpod Pros ""version 1"". This product is the Airpods Pro ""version 2"". It took me a while to convince myself to buy these, but after testing both side-by-side I noticed a few very noticeable features.

*ANC is improved. I can say this with certainty. I work hobbies that at times involve loud machinery and fellas yelling at each other. I can tell the difference in the ANC ""level"". It simply works better than before and it has this additional thing that detects vocal conversations and adapts- the V1 pros didn't have that.

*Sound quality is minorly improved - I have pretty good ears, and the bass sounds a bit better with these. Unfortunately, that's about all I can say about that.

*Battery and compatibility vastly improved; USB-C Charging has been long overdue. The wireless charging works better than v1 too- v1 heats up quite a bit and seems to charge endlessly using the official wireless apple charger. V2 doesn't have that issue. The batteries in the case and pods are nearly 2x better from what I am seeing so far.

*Quality hasn't declined; This one is important to me. I buy apple products mainly because of their build quality and how well they operate with each other. These pair nearly effortlessly with the iPhone, and the FindMy function has VASTLY improved; Making the case able to produce a sound to locate with has been a game changer. Previously with the older Airpod Pros, if you lost them while in the case, you couldn't locate them with the find-my app because they had no way to produce a noise whilst in the case. I am so glad they improved upon this quality aspect and the Airpod's quality continues to rise without noticeable compromises.

*AppleCare+: Nothing has really changed about this and that's a good thing. AppleCare+ works well, and I recommend it. I use it on all of my apple devices. I was happy to see that they made it even easier than before to get AppleCare+ bundled with the actual purchase of the airpods. Before, you had to manually activate it and that was a bit inconvienent. Plus people would forget they had AppleCare and leave their device unprotected because they didn't activate it. Glad to hear they addressed all that as well.

*Lasting technology: My final point is most important to me. I could ramble on and on about this part but long story short- I use these ALL the time, and I'm not joking- around 60-75% of the time I have these in, even without music playing. If you're the type of person who uses these a lot, then going from V1 to V2 is a no-brainer. But if you do NOT use them constantly like I do, don't worry! That's probably good for you and if you're not tethered to them like I am, then you should probably wait for the newer ""v3"" ones that are coming out sometime next year.

The Airpod Pro's v2 might not be an impressive upgrade for audiophiles, but for almost everyone else the extra bells & whistles make up for the marginally improved sound quality and make it worth the extra cost."
5,"Okay so I’m an Apple mark. All Apple all the time, the way everything works together just makes the part of my brain that demands product harmony feel good. But I have never been an earbuds guy. I’ve been a regular AirPods guy, specifically not the Pros.

I didn’t like things sticking in my ear, I’d never found one that works. And stupidly, my stupid reason for trying these is because of the USB C/Magsafe charging case because I’m trying to phase out my Lightning-charging devices. Guys I am unwell, okay? But stick with me a moment here. I also liked that the case is trackable in Find My along with the pods themselves, I’ve become a big Find My guy recently so that tickles my fancy.

So anyway I bought a pair of 3rd gen AirPods and they’re very good but largely the same as my old 2nds. So I figured hey, I’ll try the Pro 2s and worst case I return them.

I will not be returning them.

Popped em in, did the setup, and some of this is because I’ve never had good noise cancelling headphones but I was sitting 7 feet from my furnace earlier and could not hear the fan. Popped one out, hella loud fan. Back in, silence. Witchcraft, sorcery.

Sound quality is fabulous, I’m listening to Mint Jams by Casiopea right now because of that Reddit meme about the guy buying a record from Japan and it sounds so great. Holy Diver by Dio kicks ass, Kickstart My Heart puts your head right in Tommy Lee’s…drum kit. You could tell me they’re not audiophile quality or whatever and I’m sure you’re right but songs I’ve heard 1000 times sound like so much more wearing these.

It also comes with four different size eartips, and what I’ve discovered about myself is my problem has been with the size of them. Medium didn’t feel like they were in all the way. Small was a little better, went down to extra small and I can finally wear in-ear earbuds. Ordered two replacement sets because I can see where white eartips might get gross quickly.

So anyway, buy these AirPods. Connection is seamless with your Apple devices. They work great, they look good if you like AirPods. I find them very comfortable, battery life is probably fine but I haven’t gotten that far yet. Apple ropes me successfully into another part of their ecosystem, c’est la vie."
6,"The Apple AirPods Pro (2nd Generation) have proven to be a fantastic investment, delivering exceptional noise canceling, impressive sound quality, and seamless connectivity within iOS devices.

Noise canceling is one of the standout features. These AirPods effectively block out background noise, making them perfect for a variety of environments, whether you're commuting, working, or relaxing.

Sound quality is top-notch. The audio is clear and well-balanced, providing an immersive listening experience for music, podcasts, and calls. The richness of the sound enhances every listening session.

Connectivity with iOS devices is flawless. The instant pairing and stable connection make switching between Apple devices effortless and enhance the overall user experience.

USB-C charging is a very convenient addition. It offers faster charging and compatibility with modern cables, adding to the practicality of these AirPods.

Choosing the right ear tip is crucial for a secure fit. The comfort and stability of the AirPods Pro depend on selecting the correct size, so it's worth taking the time to find the best fit for your ears.

In conclusion, the Apple AirPods Pro (2nd Generation) excel in noise canceling, sound quality, and iOS connectivity. The convenience of USB-C charging and the importance of choosing the right ear tip make these AirPods a top choice for anyone seeking high-performance wireless earbuds. Highly recommended!"
7,"I like these. It’s easy (automatic) to switch between my iPhone and iPad. The fit is “okay”

Positives. Good sound quality. Voices on calls are clear. Fits and stays in the ear when walking around (but not when being active). Comfortable. Long battery life.

Negatives: when sweating they fall out noise cancellation was tiresome. Controls were difficult to operate

I found using Siri overcame using the controls. “Siri volume up. Siri answer call. “

The noise cancelation I found to be punishing on my ears. While it works well, I grew fatigued after an hour and removing the buds left a ringing sound in my ears. I have others from Sony and I can use those all day. I now leave this feature disabled except when I really need it

Fit. When I’m active and bend over the ear buds tend to fall out. I was doing yard work on a hot day and they kept falling out. As long as I stand up straight they are fine. I’ve tried other size tips with similar results

Overall very good. But not perfect"
8,"The AirPods Pro 2nd Generation are fantastic! The sound quality is top-notch, with rich bass and clear highs. Noise cancellation is superb, blocking out almost all background noise, and the transparency mode works great when needed.

The fit is comfortable and secure, perfect for long use and workouts. Battery life is excellent, lasting days without a recharge.

If you’re looking for the best wireless earbuds, these are it! Highly recommend!"
9,"Hands down, the best wireless ear buds I've ever seen. There are no downsides, and every feature works perfectly..

Features? There's a lot! The sound / noise cancelation works better than any other headphone or ear bud I've ever tried. Want to know what it's like to be deaf? Turn it on. Just don't forget it's on, you'll hear nothing! Touch controls are useful to control your content, take calls, or stop/start movies without touching the device. Best feature, transparency mode! Not only is this frequency response adjustable (EQ), and amplification controllable, but can also be used as a hearing aid!.. Yes, it's true, as I've used this and it actually works better than $8000 hearing aids (in every possible way). Another cool feature is you can charge the case on a wireless charging pad, like mag safe. Just throw it on the charger, and in about an hour, you're case and AirPods (if they're in the case) are charged. They also work with any bluetooth sound. Just press the button on the side of the case to pair, and it won't interfere when you go back to your phone or iPad, connects right away again.

The Bluetooth connectivity is second to none! Bring it near the iPhone, and it instantly connects, then need to switch to iPad, connects to that again. The range is very good too. For me, it works through out the house. This beats carrying your cell phone around to not miss a text or call. Text come is, and Siri will announce it to you.

Battery life is very good, nearly 6 hours and they recharge fast.

Comfort is good, the buds are lightweight too. They do tend to fall out of my ears, but that's my problem, not a fault of the device.

Sound quality is excellent. Although disclaimer, I have some hearing loss, so hard to judge this. I used to be a professional sound engineer, and from what hearing I have left, I can tell you they Apple nailed it! Some advice: don't become a sound engineer if you wish to have normal hearing after age 35.

Design and form factor. Again, second to none. Seems like everyone copied Apple on design, but Apple keeps leading. The case is beautiful and elegant. The magnetic closure holds the lid down, and holds the buds in the case sockets. Has one USB C port on the bottom for easy connections. Also has a lanyard loop (which I think is the Bluetooth antenna too). The rubber ear pieces are easy to remove and a great design.

Function, no bugs I can find, and if there are any I find them! No software upgrades needed.

Like I said, these are the GOAT. If you have an iPhone or iPad, or Mac, these are a must have product. If you need noise cancelation, take calls in noisy areas, these are the ones too. Highly recommended."
10,"I travel for a living, and mostly use my device for listening to audiobooks and music. I had been gifted, by my brother, a pair of Studio Beats which I liked, but got mixed reviews from others when taking phone calls. In fact, my brother was the harshest critic, so when he suggested these Airpods Pro 2 were on sale, I placed an order.

My expectations were low. The only earbuds that stay in my ears are the neckband style and the corded tapered Apple style that used to come with iPhones. Because I am often (even mostly) in loud industrial environments, a lack of volume is another frequent problem for me.

But, not to worry!

I was reading about the features and controls as I opened the package and got them in my ears, when my iPhone connected to them, and immediately began playing my music. It happened to be Stevie Ray Vaughan playing *The House is Rockin'* and I was overwhelmed. The volume was excellent, as was the sound. Second greatest fear of disappointment obliterated. Now excited, I, none the less, had to let Stevie Ray finish Rockin', because, well, it was Stevie Ray.

Making no adjustment to the fitted earpiece, the AirPods have not fallen out once-- something my Beats could not have managed to do for so long a time and with such activity. I have had them about 24 hours and with moderate-to-heavy use. Simply walking would cause my beats to fall out, no matter what fitting I used.

Moments ago, I completed the main test with a phone call with my Hi-Fi critic brother. Yesterday on the phone, wearing my Studio Beats, I went down carpeted stairs which only creaked softly, but he commented on the loud banging sound he was hearing-- like doors slamming. Today, with my AirPods Pro 2, I walked about on the hardwood floors, microwaved my coffee in the kitchen, and went back to my bedroom, and then asked him about what background noise he has heard. ""I haven't heard anything. Try moving around some.""

When I told him I had been, we were both very pleased. That was the final test.

These are the best BlueTooth audio devices I have ever had-- and I have paid more than this for some very good ones.

The noise cancelling is stunning-- almost eerie. I am not used to being in such a quiet environment. Just switched from ""Adaptive"" mode to ""Noise Cancellation"" as a big truck went by. Sound went to zero. My air conditioning and street noise (I live downtown) utterly go away by switching from ""Transparency"" to ""Noise Cancellation.""

A cool feature I had to turn OFF is ""Conversation Awareness,"" although I will probably want to make some use of it. The problem is, when I listen to music, I often sing along, and doing so with that feature enabled, quiets the music. My AirPods are not the first to complain about my singing, but perhaps the most subtle in doing so. I don't really blame them.

Everything else is at default settings, and I am most pleased with these.

Small thing, but useful to me: The case is designed for adding a wrist or neck strap. I'm buying it a nice neck-strap. I want these with me."
11,"As of now (Sept 2024), these are still the best headphones for iPhone users.

Pros: These have great sound including bass. The charge is long lasting, and the case itself will charge the buds back up a few times before the case needs a charge too. The case charges with magsafe chargers, which to me is convenient. These have great noise reduction when I mow the lawn and want to listen to music. Also, when I am on a phone call, they do a great job of isolating my voice - so if I need to take a work call when I'm out and about, folks can't hear all the background noises or music in a store, for example. These have seamless integratoin with iPhone for use with FindMy (to locate misplaced buds and/or case), and the iPhone easily finds and connects with these each time I pull them out of the case. And, the iPhone allows for a bunch of other cool settings. For example, I can set the decibel level lower so that they allow some sound through but only as loud as I want, so when at a loud concert, I can hear the music without losing my hearing. Conversely, ""transparency mode"" allows me to increase the volume so that I can talk to people who have soft voices and hear better, almost like a po-man's hearing aid. :)

Cons: They are pricey. New versions may be coming out soonish, so if you can get these on sale, they are totally worth it.

I recommend these, and there are many protective cases you can find that will fit these, which I also recommend - just make sure that the case is magsafe if you want to use that feature. Happy listening!"
12,"I got them because my wife said my work headset is making a dent on my hair (I think is just me been old). The AirPods work perfectly with my windows 11 workstation laptop. As advertised, I can be connected to Microsoft Teams and answer a call on my iPhone and quickly select the AirPods to use them for the call. So it is possible to connect to multiple devices without having to run the pairing process every time. The audio is incredibly good, no issues listening to others on calls, meetings or even music. Also no complaints from others about no been able to understand me, good microphone.

One unexpected usage that I love now is how good this AirPods can filter noise. I use them to block the noise of the gasoline mower and weed eater and they do a fantastic job, is incredible.

Only downside I found is that while using them with the Windows 11 laptop, I haven’t been able to mute the microphone from the AirPods and have to do it from the laptop. Also if using them with the windows laptop and I answer a call on my iPhone, when going back to Windows I have to open the settings app go to Bluetooth and click connect. Like I said before, it doesn’t requires a repairing, just clicking the connect button because the AirPods will prioritize the device that last pair with them (which for me is the windows laptop). None of this is a deal breaker for me and I love this little extremely expensive work headset __"
13,"I'm not an audiophile and I haven't tried every brand of earbuds out there, but of the 5 or 6 I've tried, these are far and away best. The noise cancellation amazed me. I have a window AC unit to cool my office and when I put these in I thought it turned off. It took me 2 or 3 times of taking them in and out of my ear to realize the headphones were eliminating the sound. The technology built into these is impressive. There are 4 different Noise Cancelation options from none to full noise cancelation to adaptive, which is convenient if you use them in a setting where you might have frequent conversations. The Automatic Ear detection works flawlessly, the spatial audio gives you a personalized feel to your music. The sound is crystal clear and somehow they generate significant bass as well. I was amazed to hear background vocals on songs I've listened to for years that never came through on my car or home audio system.
My biggest issue with earbuds I've had is that they always feel as though they're about to fall out. I still get that sensation somewhat with the Apple AirPods Pro 2G but so far I haven't had an issue so far, unlike my Raycons that will randomly jump out of my ears. I've mowed the lawn in my AirPods Pro, I've used them in the gym while lifting weights, and I've even run on the treadmill at full speed with no issues. The only time they got a little loose is when laying flat on my back doing a bench press. I could tell they were falling out because I could suddenly hear more ambient noise but they stayed in until I finished my reps. Apple does have a fit test feature to make sure the size of the tip is the ideal fit for your ear.
There are obviously much less expensive earbuds on the market but in my opinion these are worth every penny."
14,"When I travel internationally, I have always generally carried a pair of Bose on-ear noise cancelling headphones but on a recent trip wanted to only take the AirPods Pro instead to avoid all the bulk of packing the large on-ear headphones. I had my concerns about comfort over long periods of use and potentially having to put them back in the charging case often, but that was not the case at all. These performed exceptionally well! The noise cancellation was every bit as good as my on-ear headphones, there was no discomfort from wearing them for extended periods, in fact I preferred them over having a bulky set of earphones on my head. The sound quality was great for my preferences, watching movies and listening to music. I also had zero issues with battery life. I never had them run out of battery while watching movies or anything. When I would periodically take them out and put them back in their charging case during the flight, was enough to keep them powered up when I needed them for the entire long flights. The best part is they fit in my pocket or require almost no space at all in my carry on bag. No regrets on this purchase."
15,"If you purchase the AirPods Pro 2, this product does NOT come with a charger. It comes with a double ended USB-C cable that you can plug into a USB-C charger or a USB-C port on a computer. If however you want or need a charger/power adapter, you need to purchase this separately. I understand why Apple does this, but even they are not as clear as they might be.

To Amazon, it would be in your better interest to ensure customers know there is no charger with these Air Pods, and to suggest compatible chargers. Had I realized this, I would have purchased both through one order, saving a second Prime delivery and the associated cost.

Now onto the product.

How do they sound? They sound excellent! I have the first generation AirPods Pro, and they've served me well. The second generation has much better sound. The sound is much fuller and the bass is richer. Also, the noise reduction is far better than the first gen. Connecting these to my iPhone and my M1 MacBook Air was trivial. I can't wait to try them in my next workout at the gym in a couple days.

Would I recommend these? If you are in the Apple ecosystem, yes! I don't know how these work with non-Apple devices, so for non-Apple gear you'll need to do some research."
16,The product itself work amazingly my only issue is that it doesn’t transfer between my iPad and iPhone depending on which I uses were as my AirPod pros gen 1 did. But the real problem was the delivery. I did not know that this item need a code so the first day I missed it. Understandable. The second day however I was prepared and the delivery driver did not come to my door for the code they just drove off assuming I was home (maybe due to my car not being parked directly infront of my home. I called cousye service and got the second missed delivery waved. On day three the same thing happened but this time I was ready. The driver never left the truck and speed off before I could even open the door( got notified on my ring camera) I had to call corporate to cancel my order and send another one. I was frustrated and annoyed but they were understanding and helped me. I did eventually get my headphones but I’m not sure if it was really worth all the issues. (I did summarize my experience by a lot because it just wouldn’t all fit.)
17,"My original airpods still were charging and doing their deed in every way save for it was getting hard to hear phonecall connections, so I knew it was FINALLY time to take the plunge and get a replacement. I took the plunge and purchased Apple AirPods Pro 2 Wireless Earbuds and have never been happier. I was vested in my original pair, and had felt guilty when I acquired them thinking I'd NEVER use them. BOY was I wrong! I use these for music, for my zoom calls at work and on the go, I use them for phonecalls and LOVE them. I feel as if I couldn't do without, actually. I keep them attached to me same as my phone and watch! I LOVE the upgraded features the Pro2 offers and know that they will have as long and dependable of a life as my originals did. I highly recommend these."
18,"I haven't used airpods since the first gen ones couple of years back. The first gen ones gave me really bad vertigo it made me scared to use them since then. For the longest time I just kept using the cable earpods. From the cable getting stuck onto things, cable going bad over time, losing them constantly, I got fed up buying replacements every other month and decided to try something different. I saw the airpods pro on amazon's prime day sale and decided to take advantage of the great price.

I was pleasantly surprised how these didn't give me headaches or vertigo episodes having both buds in my ear. The Spatial Audio feature is so cool. It feels like having surround sound into your ears. The adaptive feature is nice depending how background noise affects your listening experience. The only thing it's not my favorite is the noise cancelling feature. Trust me it does a great job blocking out noise, but it makes my head feel fuzzy and uncomfortable, but maybe it's something I need to get used to over time.

These are my ride or die now. I use it all the time and the battery life is great. I accidentally left my airpods at work while I was on my break and it notified me that it was far from my phone and it gave the location where it was including the full address. Love love LOVE these."
19,"Over the years I've owned many different pairs of earbuds, mostly wired long time ago, some wireless ones, including Apple AirPods gen 2, and non-Apple models. Some of them have great sound (like triple dynamic driver), some super comfortable (notably Apple wired buds and regular AirPods gen 2), but unfortunately none of them are completely satisfactory due to various reasons, including:

- Many of them don't stay in ear long enough, they just fall off for no reason.
- Those one do stay tend to be uncomfortable after an hour or so.
- Noise cancelling or isolation doesn't really work.
- Bass is usually lousy.
- Really inconvenient to use.

I am not going to parroting the obivious good things about the AirPods pro, everyone can read online reviews, there are tons of them. What I want to say is:

- It is super comfortable. Particularly in the transparency and adaptive modes. In the noise cancelling mode I feel a bit pressure in the ear but transparency mode is great!
- It doesn't fall off often, substantially less often than any other models other than Apple AirPods gen 2.
- Great sounds!
- It is able to adjust the volume automatically -- when I talk the volume is lowered, when I go to noisy environment the volume is increased a bit.

Overall this is the best earbuds I've ever had, and I cannot imagine I could live without it."
20,"Due to the technology that is embedded within these Airpods, the active noise canceling/isolation, it creates this sensation in your ear (for some people) which is described as an ear drum suck. It doesn’t literally suck your eardrums but it’s a sensation that is described as, your ear feels as if an airpod is still in there even after you take it out which makes you hear less from one ear. This is simply your ears readjusting to the pressure that is caused by the ANC technology and it shouldn’t bring any harm to your ears. This feeling can last for a few days but it shouldn’t last for over a week and if you think something is seriously wrong then you should seek medical attention as it is better to feel safe than sorry. When this happened to me i was actually getting ready to go to the hospital as i did think something was seriously wrong with my ears, but before i left the house i switched the tips on the airpods and a few minutes after using them my ears thankfully cleared up. Other than that these Airpods are great an absolute 10/10 and are very convenient when you least expect them to be. Just putting this out here for anyone who wants to get these, i got these for around $169 when they were on sale during/a couple days before prime day."
21,"I wanna talk a bit about my version one AirPods. Somewhere along the lines the left one stopped working, and it was only static in my ear while the right one worked. As it continue to work I just ended up living with the right AirPod and didn’t use the left at all. I would periodically try it, but it was still static in my left ear. I had read up on some of the forums on Apple and saw that I wasn’t the only one experiencing this. I really like the noise, cancellation and how it fits in the ear. Now upgrading the version two it’s worth every penny. Both of the work. They fit, better in the ear and I feel that they are a little bit smaller and lighter. Without looking at the specs. I am very impressed with the sound quality as always expected from an apple product. If you’re considering upgrading The generation"
22,"I’m obsessed with these. I wish I purchased these sooner. After purchasing the wrong pair. Realizing what a big difference from the normal AirPods to the 2nd Gen. I previously owned the first gen. Thought that would be all. The whole user experience using that. Leading to these here are my favorite parts about the 2nd gen.

1) You can charge it 2 ways: MagSafe, Apple Watch charger, and with the usb c
2) adaptive noise and noise cancellation. Top notch! Worth every extra dime for it.
3) Find my feature update is significantly better since they added a speaker. Finding the case is easy. Let’s hope I don’t lose another bud.
4) the ear cushions are still my favorite. That’s one reason I had to get these buds even with the regular AirPods it makes a massive difference for my comfort.

Everything about this generation AirPod Pros 2. Very satisfied, makes focusing and listening way more enjoyable. Great upgrades from the 1st Gen."
23,"I’ve used Apple products since 1984. Yikes. I know.
I have sensitive hearing and the world of noise is often just too much. But as a recording engineer, I just love sound design. Quality recordings, etc..
With noise, cancellation, engaged it’s almost like having the music hardwired to the brain.
And with a voice command, I can readily turn on the microphones when I must engage with the world around me. Occasionally turn off the hearing protection in settings when I want to critically listen to a mix.
But most the time I protect myself and just let it compress the dynamics.
Out of everything that apples ever brought into my life, this is hands-down, my favorite.
At the other end of the spectrum the worst thing I ever got from Apple is a 2019 Mac Pro tower. What the hell were they thinking?
Or maybe I just got a lemon.
How many computers since 1984?
A lot Of them , All of them for music production."
24,"I wasn't sure I really needed these, but after an unfortunate laundry incident with my old AirPods of an earlier generation (surprisingly, they came out *mostly* okay), I started researching the Pro (2nd Generation) and decided to take the bait...SO glad I did! The noise cancellation alone is worth the cost, hands down. My husband, though not an Apple person, was so envious he started scouring the Internet to find a non-Apple product that works this well. On my last airplane flight I turned on noise cancellation for the entire flight, with voice recognition, and for the first time in my life I was able to hear the flight attendants over the engine noise. Volume control is actually easy and intuitive, if you choose to actually use them as headphones instead of just earplugs. They are so much more capable than I have yet tried, but I am already sold - and you should be too!"
25,"If you looking for wireless earbud these are hard to beat. Sounds good, the fit can be adjusted for your ears, I use these at works and I drop them the first day they are extremely durable. I’ve used AirPods in rain storms and they’ve worked for years. Here’s some issues. They turn up out of nowhere by themselves. They’ll go from whatever you set them to, to 100 before you know it. If you connect this to several apple devices, they will automatically switch between those devices. But the sound can and will become distorted when they do this. And the only way to fix it is to place AirPod back into the case and then place them back into your ears. Last they are way, they will get dirty no if and or buts about. I have AirPods that are 4-5 years old and they are gross. No amount of clean will get that of and I hate it."
26,"Lost my old pair (my friend found them in his car) and bought these. Took a little getting used to, finding the right size rubber tubes that go into my ears; the standard size was too large and kept falling out, but they come with several sizes and I found one that fits better.

Battery life is MUCH better than my original Airpods, even when they were new. The case also has a longer battery life. I used to have to carry my case with me on long walks, because the charge would only last about 90 minutes, but these always have plenty of charge left when I get home. (Since I now leave the case at home, sometimes I get false alerts from my phone that the case is lost, but it is always sitting on the counter in my kitchen where I left it!)

They stay in my ears much better than the 1st gen Airpods. I got some silicon rubber ear hooks ($6 for 3 pairs) for the Gen 1 Airpods, and they almost never fall out any more. However, you have to remove the hooks to put them in the charger case. The new 2nd Gen Airpods still fall out, about once an hour vs. about every 10 minutes for the Gen 1's, so I got some similar ear hooks for the Gen2's. These are a little easier to install but not quite as comfortable as the Gen 1 hooks. They also have to be removed before charging. With the hooks, they almost never fall out as long as I've got them seated in my ears properly.

The Gen 1 hooks don't fit the Gen 2 Airpods, so I had to get new ones.

Sound quality is fine, battery life is great."
27,"i have a google pixel 8, and really wanted a pair of quality earbuds that would be comfortable and also have nice sound, as i am kind of an audiophile
airpods pro 2 connect to my phone and laptop with no issues, and the clarity in the sound is really nice
they are super comfortable in my ears, which im really picky about
they are nice and light, and i like the button controls
they also have incredible noise cancelling and transparency
with transparency on, i can hear everything around me perfectly with the music at a decent volume
i can put them on noise cancelling on a train and barely hear anything except the music
couldn't reccommend them enough!"
28,"Really great headphones! Definitely a world of difference between this and the non-pro first gen.

I’ve listened to some more expensive over ear headphones with similar noise cancellation and those were a bit better but still for the size and price these are so impressive!

Quality is outstanding, both in sound and in durability. You can turn up the volume a lot and not have to worry about wincing at the high pitched-ness of the singing lyrics which is a huge plus for me. The balance (sorry if im not using the correct terms!) of the treble and bass is amazing.

All the noise canceling modes work extremely well and are actually more useful than I thought.

Literally cannot think of a single flaw except maybe the price (but I would say worth every penny although I haven’t officially compared price/performance ratio to other headphones)!

The fit is much helped by the various tip sizes. The appearance is also not lacking at all.

Everything is worth it and great… if you actually have a necessary use for them of course."
29,"I’m more of a bass head so the AirPods Pro aren’t exactly my match but they do have excellent sound. One thing about these that I love is the battery life. I like how I can kind of forget about it and they’re still good to go for long hours.

In terms on sound quality, they are as good as someone can expect. The bass is there while the highs are a bit too high for my liking, so I can never listen to music at full volume.

Something really impressive about these is their clarity and noise cancellation. It has to be one of the best if not the best in the market. I’d say it cancels around 90% to 95% of outside noise without having anything playing.

These are a great pick for anyone and they’re charged with usb-c so why not"
30,"I’ve only had these for a few days, but I love them. I had gotten them without knowing they had a sound cancellation feature, but holy smokes, it’s AMAZING!
I’m a caretaker for my mentally disabled brother who makes a lot of loud shrill noises, he bangs on walls and furniture, and clangs dishes and silverware together. All of those noises set me on edge terribly and give me a lot of anxiety but I’ve been using them all day and I’m so relieved.

I don’t feel stressed out or edgy now, I can’t describe how wonderful it is.
They have a feature where it turns off when you start talking and that’s perfect for my uses so I’m not having to take them out and put them in all the time.
The sound quality for music and videos is also really impressive. I’ve been listening to Nick Cave a lot and it’s beautiful lol.
I haven’t had them long so I can’t attest to durability or anything but I absolutely love them."
31,"I use these ear buds for work and home use. The best feature I think is the noise cancelling ability. Mowing the lawn on a riding lawn mower and actually hearing the music like you are sitting in your car...makes that lawn mowing enjoyable!!! Also, using them for work, the microphone picks up very well as well as the ability to seamlessly attache to when wanting to switch from speakerphone to the ear buds. I have 2 pair because I forgot them on one of my trips and it was a no thought purchase to get the 2nd pair because they are so great."
32,"I tend to buy different kinds of headphones and earbuds both because of form factor and where I want to use them. My list includes a Beats Flex (cheapest/pops out of my ears/okay sounds), Beats Fit Pro (poor rating because of tearing ear tips), Beats Solo Pro, 1st gen AirPods (last about an hour these days), and now Airpods Pro 2. I waited until the price was one of the best prices you could get, and these do not disappoint. I haven't used them very much but focus on using them to play music through Apple Music, and they sound great. I was worried about having to try different tips, but the tips that were installed on them worked great for me. One frustration might be learning the different motions to ask for Siri or to raise/lower the volume, etc. Also, the differences between Adaptive, conversation awareness, etc. That makes them powerful, but if you're gifting them to someone who just wants ear buds without much complexity, you might consider a different brand or maybe the Airpods (3rd gen) or Beats Studio+. I have not tried either of those, though. Overall, I like the feel of them, but again, I haven't used them too much, but they match my expectations."
33,"I have owned dozens of headphones and ear buds over the years. I tend to buy the next to top of the line in search of the “sweet spot” in value. So far this strategy has allowed me to keep my wallet intact while enjoying the latest advances. This time Prime Days allowed me to purchase top of the line Apple earbud at an affordable price. I had listened to previous Apple Ear Pods and didn’t find them much better or more comfortable than much less expensive competitors. But the latest 2nd Generation Air Pod Pro surprised me in its performance and comfort. I know it’s mostly a matter of taste. It just so happens that these meet my desires. I prefer to use these over every other earphone I’ve tried. Not only the quality of the sound, but the effectiveness of the noise cancellation is amazing. Lastly, I find that I can wear these earbuds much longer than any other before I feel “tired” in my ear. These are great!"
34,"I have a pair and now she has her own! These are wonderful. They have many different settings, many of which I have not used. But my favorite is the noise cancelling. I enjoy using them when riding on motorcycle, boating or while walking when the neighbors dogs like to terrorize me. They also have options like adaptive noise control which allows for when you have the unexpected conversation while listening they respond to your voice by lowering their volume. They are truly adapting to your life! They take a few days to get use to(I felt like I was in a drum the first few times using-not for sound but for equilibrium). Apple really has come up with the best pair of ear buds! And don't forget about the ability to find them if they get lost! L, R, or case they can be found if lost together or separate."
35,"I’ve been using the Apple AirPods Pro (2nd Generation) with USB-C charging for a few weeks, and they are nothing short of phenomenal.

Active Noise Cancelling: The noise cancellation is incredibly effective, significantly better than the first generation. It truly blocks out background noise, making it perfect for travel, commuting, or just focusing in a noisy environment.

Transparency Mode: The Transparency Mode is a fantastic feature. It seamlessly blends ambient sounds with your music, allowing you to stay aware of your surroundings without removing the earbuds. This is especially useful for walking in busy areas or having quick conversations.

Adaptive Audio: The Adaptive Audio feature adjusts the sound based on your environment, delivering a consistently excellent listening experience. Whether I’m in a quiet room or a bustling street, the audio quality remains top-notch.

Personalized Spatial Audio: Personalized Spatial Audio creates an immersive, theater-like experience. The sound feels like it’s coming from all around, enhancing everything from music to movies. It’s a game-changer for enjoying content on the go.

Comfort and Fit: The AirPods Pro are comfortable for extended use. The different ear tip sizes ensure a perfect fit, and they stay secure during workouts and runs.

Battery Life: The battery life is impressive, easily lasting a full day with moderate use. The USB-C charging case is convenient, providing quick and efficient charging.

Sound Quality: The sound quality is exceptional, with rich bass, clear mids, and crisp highs. Whether listening to music, podcasts, or calls, the audio is always clear and vibrant.

Overall, the Apple AirPods Pro (2nd Generation) are a significant upgrade, offering unmatched noise cancelling, adaptive audio, and a personalized listening experience. They are a must-have for anyone looking to elevate their audio experience."
36,"Had AirPods Pro 1st gen for a few years until one of the buds started crackling and driving me crazy. Bought these AirPods Pro usb-c on sale to replace the old ones. I can’t believe how much better the sound quality is! The old ones were amazing, but these new ones blow me away! They fit exactly the same (although they come with 4 sized tips instead of 3 sizes now), function almost the same, but the noise cancellation is much better now. Also the bass and clarity of music is MUCH BETTER. It’s very noticeable. It’s like I’m listening to my favorite songs for the first time again. Also the “Adaptive” sound is an amazing feature that blends the best of ANC with Transparency and adjusts dynamically. It seems like they switch between Apple devices much smoother and more predictably now too. Love these. Definitely recommend."
37,"I just want to state for the record, these AirPods are real, and they’re great! If you need wireless ear buds and are thinking of buying AirPods, personally I find them comfortable, and I like the features that they have when paired with my phone.
That being said, personally I first bought a pair of refurbished ones from Amazon and I’m like 99% sure they were fakes. I ended up returning them and then just getting my money back and buying these. I am on my phone for MANY hours a day. Like at least 4-6 usually more. I normally wear one at a time and end up switching them out no more than once or twice and that’s when I’m utilizing noise cancel, which I don’t always do. Personally I throw them on the charger every other night or so and the battery is fine."
38,"I was very hesitant on buying these as I own three sets of wireless headphones (Beats Studio Buds, Airpods 2nd gen, and Airpods Pro 1st gen). These blow all of them with comfort, noise cancellation, features and sound quality. These are very comfy for my ear as Ican wear these all day at work no problem. The noise cancellation is fantastic in every situation i used them in so far. Features such as adaptive transparency, the volume adjustment, the speaker on the case, and much more make this feel like a complete package. The sound quality is vastly improved with bass and mids being much more balanced and delivering great sound for any music you listen to. These are not HiFi headphones, but for the price, these deliver amazing sound. Overall definitely worth if you are looking for a new pair of headphones."
39,"The noise canceling is really really nice. All of the features and gestures are amazing and add to the experience. The are durable and feel sturdy. The sound quality is very good and is better when the noise canceling is on. I have heard that the battery begins to degrade after a few years, so for that reason I purchased Apple care so I can get them replaced once they do kick the bucket. The cord that comes with it is USB-C on both sides, so make sure you have another USB-C chord or a box that has a port for that. Other than that they’re great."
40,It’s very confusing that Apple calls the AirPods Pro (Generation 2) as the same as AirPods Pro 2. I ended up having to go to an Apple Store to get clarification. That only made the question more confusing because I got two opposing answers. But that’s a different story. With that said I really love the AirPods Pro 2’s. I really like that they reduce their volume when you talk. I’ve been using standard AirPods for over a year and use them all day. It’s definitely worth the extra money for the Pro 2 version. Much better battery life.
41,"And I'm blown away by the ANC. The hype is real people. As the online reviews says, this is probably the best ANC out there. It's so comfortable and fits really nicely with the default rubber cushions. Mic quality is amazing, no complaints. Has a decent weight to it when in the case. Case feels solid. Upgraded from the gen 2 version of the original airpods. I never thought I'd miss ANC because I've never used it before, but now that i have experienced it, i don't think I'll ever buy a headset without ANC feature. Music quality is definitely clearer with really good bass. I bought it during a sale because my previouse airpods started having batter and disconnecting issues after many years of use. This is also sweat and dust resistant btw."
42,"I was super nervous to order these because of some of the reviews on here. These are almost $100 cheaper than on Apple though. I purchased apple care with them from here and they were brand new when I got them. The sound is incredible, the noise cancellation is something I have never had before and I am OBSESSED, the mic works great, but I do recommend assigning the mic to your left or right because I've had issues with people hearing me when it was unassigned. Just a note. Aside from this though they are great. I have only had to charge the case once in the past month and the headphone battery lasts for hourssss too. I use these every day, all day. They are great. They last like 6-8 hours on one charge and the case lasts for weeks. The case charges very rapidly and so do the headphones. SO GLAD I said screw it and ordered them. 10/10 recommend."
43,"As a lifelong Apple user who recently returned to iPhone after a lengthy hiatus, everyone kept telling me to try AirPods. So, of course, I had to, because everyone was doing it. Regular AirPods don't fit my ears so I had to try these.

The sound is great, both inbound and outbound. The active noise canceling is great and it's really nice to have pretty close to complete silence, but set up in a way that you can actually hear certain sounds. There is a feature that automatically turns down the music when somebody is talking near you, which sounds great until you try it and then it keeps the music quiet for another few seconds, which doesn't work for intermittent conversation. Battery life is great-- hours of continuous use and more time from the case.

My subtracted star is because the Bluetooth connectivity is just kind of garbage, which I've come to expect from most Apple products. My iPhone will often tell me that it is connected to the AirPods even though it does not appear to be from the Bluetooth device menu/list, and then on top of that, sometimes it will connect to the AirPods when they are in the case. I have inspected all of the contacts to make sure everything is seated properly. Apple has no explanation as to why this is going on, even though 87 other people on the forums seem to have the exact same issue. And the ""included"" product support from the company I bought it from (this very website that I can't name or my review might be flagged) has no explanation either. Fab.

Anyway, these are good. Are they worth 5x the price of a product like MPOW? If you need the better microphones AND have they money, yes."
44,"if you have been keeping your eye on a set of head or earphones the airpod pro 2nd gen is defenetly wort it. The price is a bit heafty but it does not fail in what you pay for. they battery last for long duration, charges pretty fast and connects easily. Noise cancalation defenetly helps if your are looking to block out noise and study or even just quiet your surroundings. But if you want to stay aware of your surroundings the transparency mode works great as well. then you can just have them in the off mode so they will work normally. they did take an extra 2 days to ship but i believe that was just because of the Amazon prime day traffic."
45,"I had the very first generation AirPods and the battery life sucked. I usually used it for conference calls, and after about 6 months of use, the battery would not last more than an hour. I ended up buying 5 or 6 different headset after that and I was very happy with all. When I saw this on sale, I decided to give another try. I had Bose noise cancelling headsets but I wanted something small for travel and exercise. The noise cancelling on these headset are even better than Bose, which is supposed to have the best noise cancelling. This is great for long flights. Very happy with the purchase. It is an expensive unit but worth it if you can afford it."
46,"I've been sitting on the sidelines for about 5 years with purchasing these. I've purchased these for my kids, but I've always just used the wired versions and was just ""fine"". But let me tell you, I've been missing out! I didn't realize how much the wires got in my way or how annoying it was when I would accidentally snag them on something and yank them out of my ears. Plus the sound quality and noise cancellation are amazing! Don't wait, buy these now!"
47,"We got these for our nephew as a graduation present and he was delighted. I'm pretty sure I remember him saying they were his favorite gift, tho I'd have to check and ask (too lazy I'm not gonna, instead I'll just leave you, dear reader, wondering if it indeed was his favorite gift). I have a pair too and really like them, and I got my mom a pair a while back: she said she left them on her table for months (typical ""new unknown tech thing, don't know how long it will take to get it working"" response) but said it was super easy to set up for her and she should have done it long ago."
48,"I actually bought a pair. I did not only bought one pair. I bought two pairs one pair for my son and one pair for myself he has had before and actually just lost them a couple months ago and I thought the deal was too good to pass up on Amazon prime day so I bought two pairs one for him one for me. I was, honestly thinking I was going to return mine, until I heard the sound quality from these … PHENOMENAL!!!! So glad I bought a pair for myself. Also absolutely love these!! We are in Apple family, but I just didn’t believe in dropping that much money for headphones. Now I know why they’re that expensive because they are just that good! Once again, another home run for Apple."
49,"I was a little hesitant at the price, but I’m so glad I got them. I’ve never had earbuds like this before. The noise cancellation is better than anything I’ve ever experienced, worth the price of admission. I’ve started using them just to tune out the neighbors yard work, or even the loud fan.

Taking off the installed ear tips was a little hard, had to really pull on them before they popped off. But the smaller ear tip fits my ears more comfortably.

For some reason one AirPod charge goes down more than the other, but with Apple care I’m not worried, I know I can get it swapped if there is an issue."
50,I don’t know why I didn’t get these sooner I guess it was just trial and error with all the other different earbuds. These fit absolutely perfect in my ear and they stay in place! They also make all sorts of ear bud tip accessories I bought the over the ear hang accessory and the rubber one with a small tip to stay in ear but honestly I don’t need any of them! These fit absolutely perfect in my ears! Definitely buy these!

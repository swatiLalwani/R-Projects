Developed an empirical model in Excel to determine Unemployment rates in California.
Looked at every county dataset from FRED and compiled numbers using R-language and visualized unemployment trends, seasonal patterns, and crises using dynamic plots and statistical tools, providing real-time insights for class project.
Analyzed California's unemployment rates (1976â€“2020): Identified key trends and economic crises (e.g., 2008 recession, COVID-19 peak at 16.40%) through statistical analysis, time series decomposition, and visualization. Calculated mean (7.14%) and max (16.40%) rates, revealing cyclical labor market patterns.
